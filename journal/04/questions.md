# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > synchronous allows for lines of code to run one after another while asynchronous runs multiple lines of code simultaineously.

02. What is an event listener?

  > A listener can be created in order to listen to an event and trigger an action (or function), we often use" AppState.on"

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. In simple terms it is the rules associated with creating the architecture/design pattern of APIs.



04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > Callbacks are used to avoid immediate returns of results, they instead "await" the passing of another function.

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > Functions return "promises" and in order to "catch an  error from one we can use a try/catch method.

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > POST, GET, and PUT

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application Programming Interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > Rather then writing "function" as the signature you must write "Async"

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that act on that data. 
  Alan Kay describes it, “local retention and protection and hiding of state-process.”

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > Error code 400 means "bad request"
